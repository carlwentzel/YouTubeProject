YouTube ETL Project.

ETL, short for Extract, Transform and Load, one of the key responsibilities of a Data Engineer, was the inspiration of this project.

YouTube is a platform used to watch content creators thrive in the video and audio creation, watching up and coming creators or supporting your favorites!

The scope of this project was to use a coding language, Python, to pipeline data from CSV and JSON files into Python, transform the data, and pipeline the transformed data into SQL Server.

Furthermore, querying data from SQL Server, and then transforming the data in Python, and then pipelining the data into SQL Server Datawarehouse as Dim and Fact tables, for a Star Schema design.

The Star Schema design will allow for optimal query performance when developing dashboards in visualization tools such as PowerBi and Tableau.
